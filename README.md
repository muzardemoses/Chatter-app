```js
const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClick = () => {
	const navLinks = document.querySelector(".nav-links");
	navLinks.classList.toggle("open");
	const linkItems = document.querySelectorAll(".link-item");

		item.addEventListener("click", () => navLinks.classList.remove("open"))
	);
