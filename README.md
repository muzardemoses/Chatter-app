### My process

### What I learned

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of ðŸŽ‰</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClick = () => {
	const navLinks = document.querySelector(".nav-links");
	navLinks.classList.toggle("open");
	const linkItems = document.querySelectorAll(".link-item");

	linkItems.forEach((item) =>
		item.addEventListener("click", () => navLinks.classList.remove("open"))
	);

	setIsMenuOpen((prev) => !prev);
};
``` -->

``Somehow I need to take note of state that are mull initially e.g loggedInUser, I need to add ? to it even if I am not notified by typescript or eslint because it has code a lot of bugs and headache for me by showing in the console that `react-dom.development.js:12056 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`.``

### Continued development

I will continue to work on this project to make it better and add more features to it.
