## Overview  

Chatter is a multi-functional platform that empowers authors and readers to create and access text-based content. With features like user registration, content creation with Markdown support, personalized content discovery, social interactions, and detailed analytics, Chatter aims to provide a compelling alternative to traditional blogging platforms. Built with React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, Chatter combines modern web technologies to offer a seamless and engaging experience for content creators and readers alike.

 

### The challenge

In the age of visual content, Chatter aims to provide a haven for text-based content enthusiasts. Our goal is to create a multi-functional platform that competes with established blogging platforms. We strive to offer a seamless user experience with features like user registration, content creation with Markdown support, personalized content discovery, social interactions, and detailed analytics. By leveraging React, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, we aim to deliver a modern and engaging platform for authors and readers alike.

### My process

	** Day-1 ** 
    - I started by creating the project by running the command npm create vite app-name --template react-ts

    - I created a env file and added it to the gitignore file so that my api keys will not be exposed.

    - I then created a repository on github and pushed the project to github.

    - I then installed the necessary dependencies for the project such as react-router-dom, firebase, redux, react-redux, @reduxjs/toolkit, react-toastify, tailwindcss, dot-env, and many more.
   
    - I then created the necessary folders and files for the project such as the components folder, pages folder, and the redux folder.

### What I learned

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of ðŸŽ‰</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClick = () => {
	const navLinks = document.querySelector(".nav-links");
	navLinks.classList.toggle("open");
	const linkItems = document.querySelectorAll(".link-item");

	linkItems.forEach((item) =>
		item.addEventListener("click", () => navLinks.classList.remove("open"))
	);

	setIsMenuOpen((prev) => !prev);
};
``` -->

### Continued development

I will continue to develope my css skills especially in  positioning areas and media queries to make my websites more responsive.

I will also learn more on React
